# Retaped

The revolt.chat client re-taped from the one held together by duct tape and bad code\*
(Pronounced ree-taped)

\*Revolt basically isn't a fork anymore, as I did a full-client rewrite starting in [this commit](https://github.com/ERROR-404-NULL-NOT-FOUND/Retaped/commit/7f94d49d55b27e3896abd54b66b5359619273768)

## Features include

- Websocket connection, for updating the chat without refreshing
- Replies, for, well, replying
- Markdown (NOTE: not 1:1 RFM compatible)
- Unreads
- Emoji loading (including deprecated ones; you can use :trol: and :1984: to your heart's desire!)
- Theme loading (no need to set a new theme when you switch clients!)
- Image loading through [Autumn](https://github.com/revoltchat/autumn)
- Masquerade loading (including proxying masqueraded avatars through [January](https://github.com/revoltchat/january))
- Profile loading
- Written in nothing but vanilla HTML5, JS ES6, and CSS, making it quick to load and light to run
- Actually looks decent (looking at you, [Reduct](https://github.com/dorudolasu/reductv3)...)
